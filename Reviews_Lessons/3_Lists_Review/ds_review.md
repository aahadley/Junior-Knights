# Data Structures
Last week, we went over Python's built in data structures, and took a more in-depth look at lists. 
After that, we used dictionaries to write a basic login system. You can find the code for that in last 
week's notes.  

You can find a review of everything we went over [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html).
